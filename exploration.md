## Exploration 002: Applied ethics

### 1. Study

#### The Big Three

The three most important points I would like to you learn and understand about ethics are:

1. Ethics is not about your beliefs, habits, and predilections, but about a **group's consensus on what is the right behavior** of its members that will ensure optimal operation and longevity, whatever the domain or subject matter of interest of the group. 	

2. Crucial for ethics, and thus for all relationships and society at large, is the **individual** ability of every member to prioritize rights and values **other than their own**.

3. Ethics can be about everything and anything, but it **requires whole-system analysis** in every case.

### 2. Apply

1. Read the following sections and/or articles at the [Center for Applied Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/): 	
   - Introductory Articles
   - Approaches to Ethical Decision Making
   - A Framework for Ethical Decision Making
   - Ethics in Organizations 	
2. Answer the question: _If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?_
3. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. _How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself?_ Be specific.

### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Write a paragraph answering the question in 2.2.2. Defend your answer by explaining your reasoning.
2. Discuss the topic presented in 2.2.3, and answer the question.
